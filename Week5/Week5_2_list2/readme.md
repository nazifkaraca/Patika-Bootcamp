# Coffee List Application

Welcome to the **Coffee List Application**! This C# program allows the user to input five different coffee names through the console and display them using a `foreach` loop.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to practice working with lists and `foreach` loops in C#. Users are prompted to input five coffee names, which are then stored in a list. The program will iterate over the list and display the names on the console.

### Key Features
- Accepts user input for five coffee names.
- Stores the coffee names in a list.
- Displays the entered coffee names using a `foreach` loop.

   ```

2. Open the project in your preferred C# IDE (such as Visual Studio or JetBrains Rider).
