# Patika Plus Gala Guest List

Welcome to the **Patika Plus Gala Guest List** project! This simple C# application demonstrates how to create a list of invited guests and display their names using a `for` or `foreach` loop.

## Project Overview

This project was created as part of a practical exercise to help understand how to work with lists in C#. The goal is to generate a list of guests and display their names by iterating over the list using loops (`for` or `foreach`).

### Key Features
- Create a list of guest names.
- Use `for` or `foreach` loops to print each guest’s name.
- Basic demonstration of list handling in C#.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nazifkaraca/patika-plus-gala-guestlist.git
   ```
   
2. Open the project in your favorite C# IDE (such as Visual Studio or JetBrains Rider).

3. Build and run the project.

## Usage

Once you have the project set up and running, the program will:
1. Initialize a list with guest names.
2. Use a loop (`for` or `foreach`) to print each name to the console.

### Example Output:
```bash
Guests:
1 - Bülent Ersoy
2 - Ajda Pekkan
3 - Ebru Gündeş
4 - Hadise
5 - Hande Yener
6 - Tarkan
7 - Funda Arar
8 - Demet Akalın
```

Feel free to modify the guest list or add additional functionality if you'd like to expand the project.
