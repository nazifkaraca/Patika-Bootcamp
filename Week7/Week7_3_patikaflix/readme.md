# TV Series Management Application

This application is a console-based C# program that allows users to manage a list of popular Turkish TV series. Users can add series to the list by entering details for each one, and they can optionally create a separate list of comedy series.

## Project Overview

This project is a C# TV series management system. It enables users to input TV series details, store them in a list, and prompts the user to add another series after each entry. Additionally, the application allows users to create a filtered list of comedy series based on specific criteria.

## Features

1. **Series Entry**  
   Users can input information for each series, including:
   - Series Name
   - Release Year
   - Genre
   - Broadcast Start Year
   - Director
   - Original Broadcast Platform

   After each entry, the program prompts the user to add another series or end the input process.

2. **Filter by Genre**  
   The application allows the user to create a filtered list that only includes comedy series. This filtered list contains only:
   - Series Name
   - Genre
   - Director

3. **Sorted Display of Filtered List**  
   The filtered list of comedy series is displayed on the console, sorted by:
   - Series Name (alphabetically)
   - Director Name (alphabetically within series names)

## Usage

- Run the application through a console.
- Follow the prompts to enter details for each series.
- Once you have entered all series, choose to filter by genre (comedy) to generate a specialized list.
- The application will then display the filtered and sorted list of comedy series, showing only the relevant information.
