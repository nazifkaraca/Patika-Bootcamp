# Pratik - LINQ Project

This project aims to create a list of 10 random numbers and execute various LINQ queries on this list to display the filtered results on the console. The program is written in C# and leverages LINQ (Language Integrated Query) to efficiently query data from the list.

## About the Project

In this project, a list of 10 random numbers will be generated, and specific queries will be executed on the list using LINQ. Each query filters the list based on different criteria, displaying the results on the console. LINQ makes it easier, more readable, and efficient to perform filtering on lists.

### LINQ Queries to be Performed

The following LINQ queries will be implemented:

- **Even Numbers**: Display even numbers in the list.
- **Odd Numbers**: Display odd numbers in the list.
- **Negative Numbers**: Display negative numbers in the list.
- **Positive Numbers**: Display positive numbers in the list.
- **Numbers Between 15 and 22**: Display numbers greater than 15 and less than 22.
- **Square of Each Number**: Create a new list containing the squares of each number in the original list and display it on the console.

## Technologies Used

- **C#**: The programming language used for the project.
- **LINQ (Language Integrated Query)**: Used for querying data on the list.

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need:

- .NET Core SDK or .NET Framework
- Visual Studio or a similar C# development environment

## Usage

To run the project, use Visual Studio or the command line. When executed, the program will automatically create a random list of numbers and display the results according to the specified criteria.

Sample outputs might include:
- Even Numbers: `4, 8, 20`
- Odd Numbers: `3, 9, 15`
- Negative Numbers: `-5, -9`
- Positive Numbers: `3, 15, 20`
- Numbers Between 15 and 22: `16, 21`
- Squares of Numbers: `9, 25, 144`
